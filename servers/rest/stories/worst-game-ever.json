        "Refer to the text to check your answers when appropriate.",
        "\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a video game that came out for the Atari 2600 game system in 1982. ",
        "It was based on a very popular film of the same name. ",
        "It cost over 125 million dollars to make. ",
        "Star programmer Howard Scott Warshaw created it with consultation from Steven Spielberg. ",
        "And it is widely considered to be one of the worst video games ever created. ",
        "The massive failure of E.T. and its effects on Atari is an often-mentioned reason for the video game industry crash of 1983.",
        "\nIt was July 27th, 1982. ",
        "Howard Scott Warshaw was hot off the success of his most recent game, Raiders of the Lost Ark. He received a call from Atari C.E.O. Ray Kassar. ",
        "Atari had bought the rights to make a video game version of Spielberg's movie, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which had just been released in June. ",
        "Kassar told Warshaw that Spielberg had specifically asked for Warshaw to make the game.",
        "\nWarshaw was honored, but there was one huge problem. ",
        "Atari needed the game finished by September 1st in order to start selling it during the Christmas season.",
        "\nIt had taken Warshaw six months to create Raiders of the Lost Ark. The game he made prior to that took him seven months. ",
        "He was expected to create E.T. in around five weeks. ",
        "Warshaw just did not have enough time to program the game properly, but he accepted the challenge anyway and production began.",
        "\nSpielberg wanted Warshaw to create a simple maze game, similar to Pac-Man, but Warshaw had a bigger vision. ",
        "He wanted players to explore different environments in a 3D world. ",
        "Warshaw followed his vision.",
        "\nAtari anticipated that the game would be a huge success. ",
        "Usually companies like Atari have people test games before releasing them. ",
        "If there is something that testers really dislike, programmers can fix it before the public gets a chance to play. ",
        "Atari decided to skip testing due to time limitations. ",
        "They wanted the game released during the holiday season. ",
        "It was: E.T. was released in December of 1982.",
        "\nThe game sold very well at first. ",
        "It was a hot holiday item. ",
        "Unfortunately, Atari overestimated how many they would sell. ",
        "They made 5 million copies and they only sold "
